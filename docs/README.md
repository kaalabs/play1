This project delivers a decentralized, safety-first control system for the Vibiemme Domobar Classic / Standard (RVS) using ESP32 MCUs with MicroPython.

Priorities (in order):

1. Safety
2. Robustness
3. Maintainability
4. Modularity
5. Ease of use
6. Innovative features
7. Non-invasive UX (stock behavior preserved by default)

Start here:

- Architecture overview: [architecture.md](architecture.md)
- Safety case and requirements: [safety.md](safety.md)
- Hardware wiring and component guide: [hardware.md](hardware.md)
- First bring-up and calibration: [bringup.md](bringup.md)
- Maintenance & service procedures: [maintenance.md](maintenance.md)
- Troubleshooting: [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)
- Developer guide / contribution: [developer_guide.md](developer_guide.md)
- Specs and references: [../SPECS.md](../SPECS.md)

If you change behavior, update both code and docs. The PR template enforces this.
